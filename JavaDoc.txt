java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets:  
Constant definitions for the standard 
Charsets
. These
 charsets are guaranteed to be available on every implementation of the Java
 platform.


java.nio.channels.ClosedChannelException:  
Checked exception thrown when an attempt is made to invoke or complete an
 I/O operation upon channel that is closed, or at least closed to that
 operation.  That this exception is thrown does not necessarily imply that
 the channel is completely closed.  A socket channel whose write half has
 been shut down, for example, may still be open for reading.


java.util.regex.Matcher:  
An engine that performs match operations on a 
character sequence
 by interpreting a 
Pattern
.

 
 A matcher is created from a pattern by invoking the pattern's 
matcher
 method.  Once created, a matcher can be used to
 perform three different kinds of match operations:

 


 The 
matches
 method attempts to match the entire
   input sequence against the pattern.  


 The 
lookingAt
 method attempts to match the
   input sequence, starting at the beginning, against the pattern.  


 The 
find
 method scans the input sequence looking for
   the next subsequence that matches the pattern.  




 Each of these methods returns a boolean indicating success or failure.
 More information about a successful match can be obtained by querying the
 state of the matcher.

 
 A matcher finds matches in a subset of its input called the
 
region
. By default, the region contains all of the matcher's input.
 The region can be modified via the
region
 method and queried
 via the 
regionStart
 and 
regionEnd

 methods. The way that the region boundaries interact with some pattern
 constructs can be changed. See 
useAnchoringBounds
 and 
useTransparentBounds

 for more details.

 
 This class also defines methods for replacing matched subsequences with
 new strings whose contents can, if desired, be computed from the match
 result.  The 
appendReplacement
 and 
appendTail
 methods can be used in tandem in order to collect
 the result into an existing string buffer, or the more convenient 
replaceAll
 method can be used to create a string in which every
 matching subsequence in the input sequence is replaced.

 
 The explicit state of a matcher includes the start and end indices of
 the most recent successful match.  It also includes the start and end
 indices of the input subsequence captured by each 
capturing group
 in the pattern as well as a total
 count of such subsequences.  As a convenience, methods are also provided for
 returning these captured subsequences in string form.

 
 The explicit state of a matcher is initially undefined; attempting to
 query any part of it before a successful match will cause an 
IllegalStateException
 to be thrown.  The explicit state of a matcher is
 recomputed by every match operation.

 
 The implicit state of a matcher includes the input character sequence as
 well as the 
append position
, which is initially zero and is updated
 by the 
appendReplacement
 method.

 
 A matcher may be reset explicitly by invoking its 
reset()

 method or, if a new input sequence is desired, its 
reset(CharSequence)
 method.  Resetting a
 matcher discards its explicit state information and sets the append position
 to zero.

 threads. 


java.nio.file.Path:  
An object that may be used to locate a file in a file system. It will
 typically represent a system dependent file path.

 
 A 
Path
 represents a path that is hierarchical and composed of a
 sequence of directory and file name elements separated by a special separator
 or delimiter. A 
root component
, that identifies a file system
 hierarchy, may also be present. The name element that is 
farthest

 from the root of the directory hierarchy is the name of a file or directory.
 The other name elements are directory names. A 
Path
 can represent a
 root, a root and a sequence of names, or simply one or more name elements.
 A 
Path
 is considered to be an 
empty path
 if it consists
 solely of one name element that is empty. Accessing a file using an
 
empty path
 is equivalent to accessing the default directory of the
 file system. 
Path
 defines the 
getFileName
,
 
getParent
, 
getRoot
, and 
subpath
 methods to access the path components or a subsequence of its name
 elements.

 
 In addition to accessing the components of a path, a 
Path
 also
 defines the 
resolve
 and 
resolveSibling
 methods to combine paths. The 
relativize

 method that can be used to construct a relative path between two paths.
 Paths can be 
compared
, and tested against each other using
 the 
startsWith
 and 
endsWith
 methods.

 
 This interface extends 
Watchable
 interface so that a directory
 located by a path can be 
registered
 with a 
WatchService
 and entries in the directory watched. 


 
WARNING:
 This interface is only intended to be implemented by
 those developing custom file system implementations. Methods may be added to
 this interface in future releases. 


Accessing Files


 Paths may be used with the 
Files
 class to operate on files,
 directories, and other types of files. For example, suppose we want a 
BufferedReader
 to read text from a file "
access.log
". The
 file is located in a directory "
logs
" relative to the current working
 directory and is UTF-8 encoded.
 

     Path path = FileSystems.getDefault().getPath("logs", "access.log");
     BufferedReader reader = Files.newBufferedReader(path, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
 


Interoperability


 Paths associated with the default 
provider
 are generally interoperable
 with the 
java.io.File
 class. Paths created by other
 providers are unlikely to be interoperable with the abstract path names
 represented by 
java.io.File
. The 
toPath

 method may be used to obtain a 
Path
 from the abstract path name
 represented by a 
java.io.File
 object. The resulting 
Path
 can
 be used to operate on the same file as the 
java.io.File
 object. In
 addition, the 
toFile
 method is useful to construct a 
File
 from the 
String
 representation of a 
Path
.

 
Concurrency


 Implementations of this interface are immutable and safe for use by
 multiple concurrent threads.


java.nio.file.Files:  
This class consists exclusively of static methods that operate on files,
 directories, or other types of files.

 
 In most cases, the methods defined here will delegate to the associated
 file system provider to perform the file operations.


java.util.Collections:  
This class consists exclusively of static methods that operate on or return
 collections.  It contains polymorphic algorithms that operate on
 collections, "wrappers", which return a new collection backed by a
 specified collection, and a few other odds and ends.

 
The methods of this class all throw a 
NullPointerException

 if the collections or class objects provided to them are null.

 
The documentation for the polymorphic algorithms contained in this class
 generally includes a brief description of the 
implementation
.  Such
 descriptions should be regarded as 
implementation notes
, rather than
 parts of the 
specification
.  Implementors should feel free to
 substitute other algorithms, so long as the specification itself is adhered
 to.  (For example, the algorithm used by 
sort
 does not have to be
 a mergesort, but it does have to be 
stable
.)

 
The "destructive" algorithms contained in this class, that is, the
 algorithms that modify the collection on which they operate, are specified
 to throw 
UnsupportedOperationException
 if the collection does not
 support the appropriate mutation primitive(s), such as the 
set

 method.  These algorithms may, but are not required to, throw this
 exception if an invocation would have no effect on the collection.  For
 example, invoking the 
sort
 method on an unmodifiable list that is
 already sorted may or may not throw 
UnsupportedOperationException
.

 
This class is a member of the
 

 Java Collections Framework
.


java.util.List:  
An ordered collection (also known as a 
sequence
).  The user of this
 interface has precise control over where in the list each element is
 inserted.  The user can access elements by their integer index (position in
 the list), and search for elements in the list.


 Unlike sets, lists typically allow duplicate elements.  More formally,
 lists typically allow pairs of elements 
e1
 and 
e2

 such that 
e1.equals(e2)
, and they typically allow multiple
 null elements if they allow null elements at all.  It is not inconceivable
 that someone might wish to implement a list that prohibits duplicates, by
 throwing runtime exceptions when the user attempts to insert them, but we
 expect this usage to be rare.


 The 
List
 interface places additional stipulations, beyond those
 specified in the 
Collection
 interface, on the contracts of the
 
iterator
, 
add
, 
remove
, 
equals
, and
 
hashCode
 methods.  Declarations for other inherited methods are
 also included here for convenience.


 The 
List
 interface provides four methods for positional (indexed)
 access to list elements.  Lists (like Java arrays) are zero based.  Note
 that these operations may execute in time proportional to the index value
 for some implementations (the 
LinkedList
 class, for
 example). Thus, iterating over the elements in a list is typically
 preferable to indexing through it if the caller does not know the
 implementation.


 The 
List
 interface provides a special iterator, called a
 
ListIterator
, that allows element insertion and replacement, and
 bidirectional access in addition to the normal operations that the
 
Iterator
 interface provides.  A method is provided to obtain a
 list iterator that starts at a specified position in the list.


 The 
List
 interface provides two methods to search for a specified
 object.  From a performance standpoint, these methods should be used with
 caution.  In many implementations they will perform costly linear
 searches.


 The 
List
 interface provides two methods to efficiently insert and
 remove multiple elements at an arbitrary point in the list.


 Note: While it is permissible for lists to contain themselves as elements,
 extreme caution is advised: the 
equals
 and 
hashCode

 methods are no longer well defined on such a list.

 
Some list implementations have restrictions on the elements that
 they may contain.  For example, some implementations prohibit null elements,
 and some have restrictions on the types of their elements.  Attempting to
 add an ineligible element throws an unchecked exception, typically
 
NullPointerException
 or 
ClassCastException
.  Attempting
 to query the presence of an ineligible element may throw an exception,
 or it may simply return false; some implementations will exhibit the former
 behavior and some will exhibit the latter.  More generally, attempting an
 operation on an ineligible element whose completion would not result in
 the insertion of an ineligible element into the list may throw an
 exception or it may succeed, at the option of the implementation.
 Such exceptions are marked as "optional" in the specification for this
 interface.

 
This interface is a member of the
 

 Java Collections Framework
.


java.util.ArrayList:  
Resizable-array implementation of the 
List
 interface.  Implements
 all optional list operations, and permits all elements, including
 
null
.  In addition to implementing the 
List
 interface,
 this class provides methods to manipulate the size of the array that is
 used internally to store the list.  (This class is roughly equivalent to
 
Vector
, except that it is unsynchronized.)

 
The 
size
, 
isEmpty
, 
get
, 
set
,
 
iterator
, and 
listIterator
 operations run in constant
 time.  The 
add
 operation runs in 
amortized constant time
,
 that is, adding n elements requires O(n) time.  All of the other operations
 run in linear time (roughly speaking).  The constant factor is low compared
 to that for the 
LinkedList
 implementation.

 
Each 
ArrayList
 instance has a 
capacity
.  The capacity is
 the size of the array used to store the elements in the list.  It is always
 at least as large as the list size.  As elements are added to an ArrayList,
 its capacity grows automatically.  The details of the growth policy are not
 specified beyond the fact that adding an element has constant amortized
 time cost.

 
An application can increase the capacity of an 
ArrayList
 instance
 before adding a large number of elements using the 
ensureCapacity

 operation.  This may reduce the amount of incremental reallocation.

 
Note that this implementation is not synchronized.

 If multiple threads access an 
ArrayList
 instance concurrently,
 and at least one of the threads modifies the list structurally, it
 
must
 be synchronized externally.  (A structural modification is
 any operation that adds or deletes one or more elements, or explicitly
 resizes the backing array; merely setting the value of an element is not
 a structural modification.)  This is typically accomplished by
 synchronizing on some object that naturally encapsulates the list.

 If no such object exists, the list should be "wrapped" using the
 
Collections.synchronizedList

 method.  This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental
 unsynchronized access to the list:

   List list = Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList(...));



 The iterators returned by this class's 
iterator
 and
 
listIterator
 methods are 
fail-fast
:

 if the list is structurally modified at any time after the iterator is
 created, in any way except through the iterator's own
 
remove
 or
 
add
 methods, the iterator will throw a
 
ConcurrentModificationException
.  Thus, in the face of
 concurrent modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather
 than risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined
 time in the future.

 
Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed
 as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the
 presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification.  Fail-fast iterators
 throw 
ConcurrentModificationException
 on a best-effort basis.
 Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this
 exception for its correctness:  
the fail-fast behavior of iterators
 should be used only to detect bugs.

java.util.regex.Pattern:  
A compiled representation of a regular expression.

 
 A regular expression, specified as a string, must first be compiled into
 an instance of this class.  The resulting pattern can then be used to create
 a 
Matcher
 object that can match arbitrary 
character sequences
 against the regular
 expression.  All of the state involved in performing a match resides in the
 matcher, so many matchers can share the same pattern.

 
 A typical invocation sequence is thus

 

 Pattern p = Pattern.
compile
("a*b");
 Matcher m = p.
matcher
("aaaaab");
 boolean b = m.
matches
();


 A 
matches
 method is defined by this class as a
 convenience for when a regular expression is used just once.  This method
 compiles an expression and matches an input sequence against it in a single
 invocation.  The statement

 

 boolean b = Pattern.matches("a*b", "aaaaab");


 is equivalent to the three statements above, though for repeated matches it
 is less efficient since it does not allow the compiled pattern to be reused.

 
 Instances of this class are immutable and are safe for use by multiple
 concurrent threads.  Instances of the 
Matcher
 class are not safe for
 such use.

Backslashes, escapes, and quoting


 The backslash character (
'\'
) serves to introduce escaped
 constructs, as defined in the table above, as well as to quote characters
 that otherwise would be interpreted as unescaped constructs.  Thus the
 expression 
\\
 matches a single backslash and 
\{
 matches a
 left brace.

 
 It is an error to use a backslash prior to any alphabetic character that
 does not denote an escaped construct; these are reserved for future
 extensions to the regular-expression language.  A backslash may be used
 prior to a non-alphabetic character regardless of whether that character is
 part of an unescaped construct.

 
 Backslashes within string literals in Java source code are interpreted
 as required by
 
The Java™ Language Specification

 as either Unicode escapes (section 3.3) or other character escapes (section 3.10.6)
 It is therefore necessary to double backslashes in string
 literals that represent regular expressions to protect them from
 interpretation by the Java bytecode compiler.  The string literal
 
"\b"
, for example, matches a single backspace character when
 interpreted as a regular expression, while 
"\\b"
 matches a
 word boundary.  The string literal 
"\(hello\)"
 is illegal
 and leads to a compile-time error; in order to match the string
 
(hello)
 the string literal 
"\\(hello\\)"

 must be used.

 
Character Classes


 Character classes may appear within other character classes, and
    may be composed by the union operator (implicit) and the intersection
    operator (
&&
).
    The union operator denotes a class that contains every character that is
    in at least one of its operand classes.  The intersection operator
    denotes a class that contains every character that is in both of its
    operand classes.

    
 The precedence of character-class operators is as follows, from
    highest to lowest:

    


1    


Literal escape    


\x


2    


Grouping


[...]


3    


Range


a-z


4    


Union


[a-e][i-u]


5    


Intersection


[a-z&&[aeiou]]




 Note that a different set of metacharacters are in effect inside
    a character class than outside a character class. For instance, the
    regular expression 
.
 loses its special meaning inside a
    character class, while the expression 
-
 becomes a range
    forming metacharacter.

 
Line terminators


 A 
line terminator
 is a one- or two-character sequence that marks
 the end of a line of the input character sequence.  The following are
 recognized as line terminators:

 


 A newline (line feed) character (
'\n'
),

   
 A carriage-return character followed immediately by a newline
   character (
"\r\n"
),

   
 A standalone carriage-return character (
'\r'
),

   
 A next-line character (
'\u0085'
),

   
 A line-separator character (
'\u2028'
), or

   
 A paragraph-separator character (
'\u2029
).

 


If 
UNIX_LINES
 mode is activated, then the only line terminators
 recognized are newline characters.

 
 The regular expression 
.
 matches any character except a line
 terminator unless the 
DOTALL
 flag is specified.

 
 By default, the regular expressions 
^
 and 
$
 ignore
 line terminators and only match at the beginning and the end, respectively,
 of the entire input sequence. If 
MULTILINE
 mode is activated then
 
^
 matches at the beginning of input and after any line terminator
 except at the end of input. When in 
MULTILINE
 mode 
$

 matches just before a line terminator or the end of the input sequence.

 
Groups and capturing


Group number


 Capturing groups are numbered by counting their opening parentheses from
 left to right.  In the expression 
((A)(B(C)))
, for example, there
 are four such groups: 




1    


((A)(B(C)))


2    


(A)


3    


(B(C))


4    


(C)




 Group zero always stands for the entire expression.

 
 Capturing groups are so named because, during a match, each subsequence
 of the input sequence that matches such a group is saved.  The captured
 subsequence may be used later in the expression, via a back reference, and
 may also be retrieved from the matcher once the match operation is complete.

 
Group name


A capturing group can also be assigned a "name", a 
named-capturing group
,
 and then be back-referenced later by the "name". Group names are composed of
 the following characters. The first character must be a 
letter
.

 


 The uppercase letters 
'A'
 through 
'Z'

        (
'\u0041'
 through 
'\u005a'
),
   
 The lowercase letters 
'a'
 through 
'z'

        (
'\u0061'
 through 
'\u007a'
),
   
 The digits 
'0'
 through 
'9'

        (
'\u0030'
 through 
'\u0039'
),
 


 A 
named-capturing group
 is still numbered as described in
 
Group number
.

 
 The captured input associated with a group is always the subsequence
 that the group most recently matched.  If a group is evaluated a second time
 because of quantification then its previously-captured value, if any, will
 be retained if the second evaluation fails.  Matching the string
 
"aba"
 against the expression 
(a(b)?)+
, for example, leaves
 group two set to 
"b"
.  All captured input is discarded at the
 beginning of each match.

 
 Groups beginning with 
(?
 are either pure, 
non-capturing
 groups
 that do not capture text and do not count towards the group total, or
 
named-capturing
 group.

 
 Unicode support 


 This class is in conformance with Level 1 of 
Unicode Technical
 Standard #18: Unicode Regular Expression
, plus RL2.1
 Canonical Equivalents.
 


Unicode escape sequences
 such as 
\u2014
 in Java source code
 are processed as described in section 3.3 of
 
The Java™ Language Specification
.
 Such escape sequences are also implemented directly by the regular-expression
 parser so that Unicode escapes can be used in expressions that are read from
 files or from the keyboard.  Thus the strings 
"\u2014"
 and
 
"\\u2014"
, while not equal, compile into the same pattern, which
 matches the character with hexadecimal value 
0x2014
.
 

 A Unicode character can also be represented in a regular-expression by
 using its 
Hex notation
(hexadecimal code point value) directly as described in construct
 
\x{...}
, for example a supplementary character U+2011F
 can be specified as 
\x{2011F}
, instead of two consecutive
 Unicode escape sequences of the surrogate pair
 
\uD840
\uDD1F
.
 

 Unicode scripts, blocks, categories and binary properties are written with
 the 
\p
 and 
\P
 constructs as in Perl.
 
\p{
prop
}
 matches if
 the input has the property 
prop
, while 
\P{
prop
}

 does not match if the input has that property.
 

 Scripts, blocks, categories and binary properties can be used both inside
 and outside of a character class.

 


Scripts
 are specified either with the prefix 
Is
, as in
 
IsHiragana
, or by using  the 
script
 keyword (or its short
 form 
sc
)as in 
script=Hiragana
 or 
sc=Hiragana
.
 

 The script names supported by 
Pattern
 are the valid script names
 accepted and defined by
 
UnicodeScript.forName
.

 


Blocks
 are specified with the prefix 
In
, as in
 
InMongolian
, or by using the keyword 
block
 (or its short
 form 
blk
) as in 
block=Mongolian
 or 
blk=Mongolian
.
 

 The block names supported by 
Pattern
 are the valid block names
 accepted and defined by
 
UnicodeBlock.forName
.
 


Categories
 may be specified with the optional prefix 
Is
:
 Both 
\p{L}
 and 
\p{IsL}
 denote the category of Unicode
 letters. Same as scripts and blocks, categories can also be specified
 by using the keyword 
general_category
 (or its short form
 
gc
) as in 
general_category=Lu
 or 
gc=Lu
.
 

 The supported categories are those of
 


The Unicode Standard
 in the version specified by the
 
Character
 class. The category names are those
 defined in the Standard, both normative and informative.
 


Binary properties
 are specified with the prefix 
Is
, as in
 
IsAlphabetic
. The supported binary properties by 
Pattern

 are
 


 Alphabetic
   
 Ideographic
   
 Letter
   
 Lowercase
   
 Uppercase
   
 Titlecase
   
 Punctuation
   
 Control
   
 White_Space
   
 Digit
   
 Hex_Digit
   
 Join_Control
   
 Noncharacter_Code_Point

 The following 
Predefined Character classes
 and 
POSIX character classes

Annex C: Compatibility Properties

 of 
Unicode Regular Expression
 
, when

 Constructs supported by this class but not by Perl: 




 Character-class union and intersection as described
    
above
.




 Notable differences from Perl: 




 In Perl, 
\1
 through 
\9
 are always interpreted
    as back references; a backslash-escaped number greater than 
9
 is
    treated as a back reference if at least that many subexpressions exist,
    otherwise it is interpreted, if possible, as an octal escape.  In this
    class octal escapes must always begin with a zero. In this class,
    
\1
 through 
\9
 are always interpreted as back
    references, and a larger number is accepted as a back reference if at
    least that many subexpressions exist at that point in the regular
    expression, otherwise the parser will drop digits until the number is
    smaller or equal to the existing number of groups or it is one digit.
    


 Perl uses the 
g
 flag to request a match that resumes
    where the last match left off.  This functionality is provided implicitly
    by the 
Matcher
 class: Repeated invocations of the 
find
 method will resume where the last match left off,
    unless the matcher is reset.  


 In Perl, embedded flags at the top level of an expression affect
    the whole expression.  In this class, embedded flags always take effect
    at the point at which they appear, whether they are at the top level or
    within a group; in the latter case, flags are restored at the end of the
    group just as in Perl.
